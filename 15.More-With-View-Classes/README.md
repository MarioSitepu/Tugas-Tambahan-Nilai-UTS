# 15: More With View Classes

Group views into a class, sharing configuration, state, and logic.

## Background

As part of its mission to help build more ambitious web applications, Pyramid provides many more features for views and view classes.

The Pyramid documentation discusses views as a Python "callable". This callable can be a function, an object with a `__call__`, or a Python class. In this last case, methods on the class can be decorated with `@view_config` to register the class methods with the configurator as a view.

At first, our views were simple, free-standing functions. Many times your views are related: different ways to look at or work on the same data, or a REST API that handles multiple operations. Grouping these together as a view class makes sense:

- Group views.
- Centralize some repetitive defaults.
- Share some state and helpers.

Pyramid views have view predicates that determine which view is matched to a request, based on factors such as the request method, the form parameters, and so on. These predicates provide many axes of flexibility.

The following shows a simple example with four operations: view a home page which leads to a form, save a change, and press the delete button.

## Objectives

- Group related views into a view class.
- Centralize configuration with class-level `@view_defaults`.
- Dispatch one route/URL to multiple views based on request data.
- Share states and logic between views and templates via the view class.

## Steps

First we copy the results of the templating step:

```bash
cd ..; cp -r templating more_view_classes; cd more_view_classes
$VENV/bin/pip install -e .
```

Our route in `more_view_classes/tutorial/__init__.py` needs some replacement patterns:

```python
from pyramid.config import Configurator


def main(global_config, **settings):
    config = Configurator(settings=settings)
    config.include('pyramid_chameleon')
    config.add_route('home', '/')
    config.add_route('hello', '/howdy/{first}/{last}')
    config.scan('.views')
    return config.make_wsgi_app()
```

Our `more_view_classes/tutorial/views.py` now has a view class with several views:

```python
from pyramid.view import (
    view_config,
    view_defaults
    )


@view_defaults(route_name='hello')
class TutorialViews:
    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.view_name = 'TutorialViews'

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        first = self.request.matchdict['first']
        last = self.request.matchdict['last']
        return first + ' ' + last

    @view_config(route_name='home', renderer='home.pt')
    def home(self):
        return {'page_title': 'Home View'}

    # Retrieving /howdy/first/last the first time
    @view_config(renderer='hello.pt')
    def hello(self):
        return {'page_title': 'Hello View'}

    # Posting to /howdy/first/last via the "Edit" submit button
    @view_config(request_method='POST', renderer='edit.pt')
    def edit(self):
        new_name = self.request.params['new_name']
        return {'page_title': 'Edit View', 'new_name': new_name}

    # Posting to /howdy/first/last via the "Delete" submit button
    @view_config(request_method='POST', request_param='form.delete',
                 renderer='delete.pt')
    def delete(self):
        print ('Deleted')
        return {'page_title': 'Delete View'}
```

Our primary view needs a template at `more_view_classes/tutorial/home.pt`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Quick Tutorial: ${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</h1>

<p>Go to the <a href="${request.route_url('hello', first='jane',
        last='doe')}">form</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Ditto for our other view from the previous section at `more_view_classes/tutorial/hello.pt`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Quick Tutorial: ${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</h1>
<p>Welcome, ${view.full_name}</p>
<form method="POST"
      action="${request.current_route_url()}">
    <input name="new_name"/>
    <input type="submit" name="form.edit" value="Save"/>
    <input type="submit" name="form.delete" value="Delete"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

We have an edit view that also needs a template at `more_view_classes/tutorial/edit.pt`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Quick Tutorial: ${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</h1>
<p>You submitted <code>${new_name}</code></p>
</body>
</html>
```

And finally the delete view's template at `more_view_classes/tutorial/delete.pt`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Quick Tutorial: ${page_title}</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>${view.view_name} - ${page_title}</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Our tests in `more_view_classes/tutorial/tests.py` fail, so let's modify them:

```python
import unittest

from pyramid import testing


class TutorialViewTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.config = testing.setUp()

    def tearDown(self):
        testing.tearDown()

    def test_home(self):
        from .views import TutorialViews

        request = testing.DummyRequest()
        inst = TutorialViews(request)
        response = inst.home()
        self.assertEqual('Home View', response['page_title'])


class TutorialFunctionalTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        from tutorial import main
        app = main({})
        from webtest import TestApp

        self.testapp = TestApp(app)

    def test_home(self):
        res = self.testapp.get('/', status=200)
        self.assertIn(b'TutorialViews - Home View', res.body)
```

Now run the tests:

```bash
$VENV/bin/pytest tutorial/tests.py -q
..
2 passed in 0.40 seconds
```

Run your Pyramid application with:

```bash
$VENV/bin/pserve development.ini --reload
```

Open http://localhost:6543/howdy/jane/doe in your browser. Click the Save and Delete buttons, and watch the output in the console window.

## Analysis

As you can see, the four views are logically grouped together. Specifically:

- We have a home view available at http://localhost:6543/ with a clickable link to the hello view.
- The second view is returned when you go to `/howdy/jane/doe`. This URL is mapped to the hello route that we centrally set using the optional `@view_defaults`.
- The third view is returned when the form is submitted with a POST method. This rule is specified in the `@view_config` for that view.
- The fourth view is returned when clicking on a button such as `<input type="submit" name="form.delete" value="Delete"/>`.

In this step we show, using the following information as criteria, how to decide which view to use:

- Method of the HTTP request (GET, POST, etc.)
- Parameter information in the request (submitted form field names)

We also centralize part of the view configuration to the class level with `@view_defaults`, then in one view, override that default just for that one view. Finally, we put this commonality between views to work in the view class by sharing:

- State assigned in `TutorialViews.__init__`
- A computed value

These are then available both in the view methods and in the templates (e.g., `${view.view_name}` and `${view.full_name}`).

As a note, we made a switch in our templates on how we generate URLs. We previously hardcoded the URLs, such as:

```html
<a href="/howdy/jane/doe">Howdy</a>
```

In `home.pt` we switched to:

```html
<a href="${request.route_url('hello', first='jane',
    last='doe')}">form</a>
```

Pyramid has rich facilities to help generate URLs in a flexible, non-error prone fashion.

## Extra Credit

1. Why could our template do `${view.full_name}` and not have to do `${view.full_name()}`?

2. The edit and delete views are both receive POST requests. Why does the edit view configuration not catch the POST used by delete?

3. We used Python `@property` on `full_name`. If we reference this many times in a template or view code, it would re-compute this every time. Does Pyramid provide something that will cache the initial computation on a property?

4. Can you associate more than one route with the same view?

5. There is also a `request.route_path` API. How does this differ from `request.route_url`?
